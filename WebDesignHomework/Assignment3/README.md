## **Assignment 3**

I'm struggling to follow the assignment 3 requirements. Personally I am visual learner so I'm struggling to make sure I'm doing everything correctly. It would be very helpful to have some sort of video or photos to follow along to ensure I'm doing my best work. I want to thrive and succeed in this course since it will provide me with helpfull skills in the business world.

I am unsure what to add for my image, list, and link so I'm putting some fun personal information.

My three favorite animals are:
  - Capybaras
  - Quokkas
  - Dogs
