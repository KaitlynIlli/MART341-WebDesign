# Week 12
## Katie Illi

# 6 Required Items
- Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
    - Not sure if it counts becvause I did it last week - but I made the title header 500% larger to make it stick out more
- Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
    - I changed the border and inside color of the buttons in the hover effect - I found previously that it made the button disappear since the hover shade was the same as the background, I also made the stroke a bit thicker and a darker shade
- Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
    - I made the information in the history tab into columns instead of rows stacked on top of each other. Changing the padding around so they comfortable fit the page
    - I also added comfortable padding to all of the images I added on the history page
- Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.
    - The columns with the history and information on Alpha Phi are all exactly centered with one another and spaced evenly from each edge of the website
- Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
    - I made the footer relative so it did not move and was equal to the height of the page and making sure it was evenly spaced from the bottom of the main section
