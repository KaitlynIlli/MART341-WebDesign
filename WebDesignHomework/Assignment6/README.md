#Website Choice
I'm choosing to continue the philanthropy sit for my sorority. I'm not sure what functions I want the website to have yet. I just know I want it to be unique to our chapter.

##After Assignment Reflection
Adjusting the colors help bring life to the page. The colors are representative of Alpha Phi and have a clean look and feel to them. I didn't have much of a plan starting off the assignment. I think the layout looks clean and easily useable. I added the Red Dress section on a whim. I knew it was important to highlight the current event and draw the most attention to that. I didn't experiment with float and margin. My biggest challenge with this assignment was overcoming some coding issues. I'm still trying to get the hang of the all the tricks. I used TODO a ton in helping figure out how to program each skill. The only struggle I'm still facing is figuring out how to get my GitHub Website working.
