# Required Items
- At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.
    - Page 1 - index.html
    - Page 2 - history.html
    - Page 3 - contact.html
    - Page 4 - about.html
    - Page 5 - howto.html
- Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
    - After testing the website out on multiple devices it works very well! it is not a crowded website so there is not much that can be an issue with it
- Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.
    - I added media queries to each page for mobile use
- Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.
    - at the top of each page I have a small naviagtion link - there is not many pages to go to and I did not find having a dropdown box necessary for this
- Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.
    - Did not find a dropdown box appplicable with the size of the website
