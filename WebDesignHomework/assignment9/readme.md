# Week 9
## Katie Illi

# note
I remade this website for the assignments i turned in late, there was a lot of clutter in my previous sites and wanted to start from scratch with a cleaner look

# Required Items
- Three or more pages.
    - I added 4 pages I will go onto in each week and as i get ready to turn this in for my final
    - Pages I have done for this week:
        - index.html
        - contact.html
        - howto.html
        - about.html
- A complete set of instructions or a how-to guide.
    - I added a page about how to plan and have a great sisterhood event! there aren't many things to make lists about in a sorority so this is what I think would be the best
- Use of inline and embedded styles.
    - have a style sheet attached and all elements are seperated well
- Images (preferably your own, but sourced, fair-use images are also allowed).
    - I have an image of our chapter on the front page
- One or more embedded media (video, audio, Google Maps, etc).
    - I have the google map link to our house on the contact page (contact.html)
- Structural and semantic markup, including a well-organized block-style page structure
    - very organized page structure
- Clean, legible coding
