One aspect of my website that I am proud of is the informational sections. It's really helpful for people outside of greek life to have insight on what our goals are. I like the list format of it. It keeps everything short and clean. I also like the fact that I have used maroon and dark gray as my color choices. The alpha phi colors are silver and bordeau so it's fun to have similar colors for the website.
