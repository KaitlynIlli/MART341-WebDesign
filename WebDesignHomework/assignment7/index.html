<!--I wanted to make the page feel simple and clean-->
<!--I chose these particular colors for my page because they are close to the colors that represent Alpha Phi-->
<!--We already have a website for our donations and tickets. I provided the link to it in the Donate Here link. I enjoyed the thought of having a website that is accessible all year long.-->
