## *Assignment 4*

1. Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?
   - Web pages operate by requesting information from servers and connections. Whether you're browsing a site for shopping or viewing images a website continuously retrieves data from servers to determine where to take your screen next (such as the next page, a different link, or the checkout).
  
2. What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?
   - The DOM connects all parts of a website. It links the homepage to the shopping cart, product information, etc.

3. HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?
   - HTML is used for creating web pages and focuses on how it will look, while XML is designed for storing and transporting data. XHTML combines HTML's structure with XML's rules, requiring all tags to be properly nested and closed.

4. What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?
   - !DOCTYPE.html
   - .html
   - head
   - body

5. What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?
   - The index.html page means the website's homepage. When people visit a website it's what they see first. It should be placed in the area where all the main page folders are located.
   
6. Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?
   - The top naming practices are using key words or symbols that make the code or files easily accessible. An example of this would be adding Page 1 to the code if it was meant for the first page on a website.
