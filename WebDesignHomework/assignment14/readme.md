# Required Items
- 3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme.
    - did not add any pages from last time!
        - still have the index, history, contact, about, and howto page!
- Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.
    - integrated framework into my website, not sure how much I like it. It messed with a lot of the personality of the website even though it made it a bit more responsive.
- Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.
    - imported elements that made the website more full - adding more boxes and borders for all the aligned elements
- HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations.
    - for animations I added a shine effect to the header bar at the top of the screen to make it look shiny
- JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site.
    - when i added the bootstrap into the code I added JavaScript alongside it
