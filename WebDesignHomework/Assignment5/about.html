#Why I chose each website idea

##Website 1
    ###I chose this first website because I like the idea of people being to connect with one another and the internet is a fantastic place to do that.

##Website 2
    ###I chose this second idea because of the ease it will give me in the future. If I have the skills to help build my own website, it would be very helpful for whatever business I get into.

##Website 3
    ###I chose this last idea because of my involvment in my sorority and seeing the struggles. I want to find a way for our philanthropy to reach a wider audience, which will raise more money for our cause.
