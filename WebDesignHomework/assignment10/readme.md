# Week 10
## Katie Illi

# Required Items
- Create a page with an external CSS style sheet
    - I have had an external style sheet
- Use at least 1 class selector
    - for my button on the sisterhood page I made a class for the button that brings it to the sisterhood planning sheet from last weeks assignment.
- Use at least 1 ID selector
    - I have a lot of different ID's across the pages styling for multiple different uses. Some of them are colors and some of them are related to functionality of the website like text alignment.

# Other elements
- Different background colors
    - Changed the background colros to a more chalky white so it helps the brighter pink pop out
- Borders
    - I added borders and buttons to the navigation bar at the top of the page
- And more (feel free to experiment!)
    - Added hover effects to the buttons to slightly change the color on the button to make it pop out more.
    - Added a stroke to the title on the index page to help it look more modern and flashy! Also very pink which I love!
